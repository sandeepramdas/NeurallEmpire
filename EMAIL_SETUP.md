# ðŸ“§ Email Notification Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up email notifications for the NeurallEmpire website so you receive an email whenever someone submits the consultation form or makes a payment.

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Implementation

I've already implemented a comprehensive email system with the following features:

### âœ… What's Already Done:
- **EmailJS Integration**: Client-side email sending without needing a backend server
- **Lead Notifications**: Automatic emails when someone submits the consultation form
- **Payment Notifications**: Automatic emails when someone makes a payment
- **Fallback System**: Opens default email client if EmailJS fails
- **Lead Scoring**: Automatically calculates lead priority and urgency
- **Multiple Templates**: Separate templates for leads and payments

### ðŸ“Š Email Content Includes:
- **Lead Notifications**:
  - Contact name, email, company, phone
  - Budget information
  - Message content
  - Lead score and urgency level
  - Timestamp and source

- **Payment Notifications**:
  - Plan type and amount
  - Customer information
  - Payment ID
  - Revenue impact

## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create EmailJS Account
1. Go to [emailjs.com](https://www.emailjs.com/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email address

### Step 2: Configure Email Service
1. In EmailJS dashboard, go to **Email Services**
2. Click **Add New Service**
3. Choose your email provider (Gmail recommended):
   - **Gmail**: Connect your Gmail account
   - **Outlook**: Connect your Outlook account
   - **Yahoo**: Connect your Yahoo account
   - Or configure SMTP for custom email

### Step 3: Create Email Templates

#### Template 1: Lead Notification
1. Go to **Email Templates** in EmailJS dashboard
2. Click **Create New Template**
3. Use this template:

```
Subject: ðŸ§  New Lead: {{from_name}} from {{company}}

New lead received from NeurallEmpire website:

ðŸ‘¤ Contact Information:

ðŸ’° Business Details:
Budget: {{budget}}

ðŸ“Š Lead Analysis:

ðŸ•’ Details:

---
This email was automatically generated by the NeurallEmpire lead notification system.
```

#### Template 2: Payment Notification
1. Create another template for payments:

```
Subject: ðŸ’° New Payment: {{payment_plan}} Plan - {{payment_amount}}

Payment received from NeurallEmpire:

ðŸ’³ Payment Details:
Plan: {{payment_plan}}

```

### Step 4: Update Configuration
1. In the EmailJS dashboard, note down:
   - **Public Key** (from Account settings)
   - **Service ID** (from Email Services)
   - **Template ID** (from Email Templates)

2. Update `/assets/js/config.js`:

```javascript
// EmailJS Configuration
emailjs: {
    publicKey: 'YOUR_ACTUAL_PUBLIC_KEY',
    serviceId: 'YOUR_ACTUAL_SERVICE_ID',
    templateId: 'YOUR_ACTUAL_TEMPLATE_ID',
    enabled: true // Change this to true
},
```

### Step 5: Test the System
1. Save your changes and refresh the website
2. Fill out the contact form with test data
3. Submit the form
4. Check your email for the notification

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Options

### Lead Scoring System
The system automatically scores leads based on:
- **Budget**: Higher budget = higher score
- **Company**: Provided company = +15 points
- **Phone**: Provided phone = +10 points
- **Message**: Longer message = +10 points

### Urgency Levels
- **High**: Budget â‰¥ $2,400 or message contains "urgent"
- **Medium**: Default
- **Low**: Budget < $600

### Email Destinations
Currently set to: `sandeepramdaz@neurallempire.com`

To change this, update the `contact.email` in `/assets/js/config.js`.

## ðŸš¨ Fallback System

If EmailJS fails, the system will:
1. Try EmailJS first
2. If that fails, open your default email client with pre-filled content
3. Save form data to browser localStorage as backup

## ðŸ“± Mobile Compatibility

The email system works on all devices and browsers that support JavaScript.

## ðŸ”’ Security Features

- No sensitive data exposed in frontend code
- EmailJS handles all email delivery securely
- Form data validation before sending
- Rate limiting built into EmailJS

## ðŸ’° Cost

- **EmailJS Free Tier**: 200 emails/month
- **Paid Plans**: Start at $15/month for 1,000 emails
- More than sufficient for lead notifications

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **No emails received**:
   - Check EmailJS configuration
   - Verify `enabled: true` in config
   - Check spam folder

2. **EmailJS not working**:
   - Verify internet connection
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Ensure EmailJS service is active

3. **Template not found**:
   - Verify template ID in config
   - Ensure template is published in EmailJS

### Support
If you need help setting this up, the fallback system will still work by opening your email client automatically.
