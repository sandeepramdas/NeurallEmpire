## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Access token required"
**Solution:** Make sure you're including the Authorization header with your token

### Issue: "Agent limit reached"
**Solution:** Your organization has reached the maximum number of agents for your plan. Delete unused agents or upgrade your plan.

### Issue: Agent creation fails
**Solution:**
1. Check that all required fields are filled (name, type)
2. Verify token is valid and not expired
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Check network tab for API response

### Issue: Agents not loading
**Solution:**
1. Check that you're logged in
2. Refresh the page
3. Clear browser cache
4. Check browser console for errors

   - Track usage count
   - Monitor success rate
   - Check average response time

5. **Iterate and Improve**
   - Refine prompts based on results
   - Adjust configuration
   - Add new capabilities as needed
